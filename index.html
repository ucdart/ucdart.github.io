        <h3>Welcome to the website of the Davis Adaptive RF Technology (DART) lab</h3>
        <p>We are a group of researchers with a keen interest in many exciting areas of high frequency electronics. The definition of "high frequency" here refers to a range of a few hundred megahertz to hundreds of gigahertz. Our research interests  include:
             <ul>
                     	<li>Reconfigurable high frequency devices and components, particularly tunable filters and matching networks;</li>
                	<li>High efficiency and high power amplifiers, oscillators, and frequency synthesizers; </li>
			<li>Millimeter-wave synthetic imaging systems</li>
			<li>High frequency communication and radar systems and their application in biomedical, societal, and environmental applications. </li>
             </ul>
        </p>

	<p>Critical to our scientific research efforts is a fundamental understanding of the phenomena, physics, and engineering principles of high frequency electronics. A major mission of our work is to formulate and disseminate such knowledge through the curriculum and the training we provide to both the students and researchers at the University. </p>
	
	<!--
	<p>We are also committed to fostering STEM education at all levels through a variety of education and outreach activities, besides fulfilling university teaching obligations. We work closely with outside collaborators to benefit the local, regional and global community. </p>

	<p>The DART lab is housed in Kemper Hall on the beautiful UC Davis campus. The lab is affiliated with the Davis Millimeter-wave Research Center (DMRC). The DMRC is broadly focused on fostering millimeter wave technology for wireless communications, radar, sensing, and imaging systems. </p>
