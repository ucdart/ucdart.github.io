        <h3>Welcome to the website of the Davis Adaptive RF Technology (DART) lab</h3>
        <p>We are a group of researchers with a keen interest in many exciting areas of high frequency electronics. The definition of "high frequency" here refers to a range of a few hundred megahertz to hundreds of gigahertz. Our research interests  include:
             <ul>
                     <li>Reconfigurable high frequency devices and components, particularly tunable filters and matching networks;</li>
                     <li>High efficiency and high power amplifiers, oscillators, and frequency synthesizers; </li>
			<li>High frequency communication and radar systems and their application in biomedical, societal, and environmental applications. </li>
             </ul>   
                
        </p>
	<p>Critical to our scientify research efforts is a fundamental understanding of the phenomena, physics, and engineering principles of high frequency electronics. A major mission of our work is to formulate and disseminate such knowledge through the curriculum and the training we provide to both the students and researchers at the University. We are also committed to fostering STEM education at all levels through a variety of education and outreach activities, besides fulfilling university teaching obligations. We take full advantage of the resources at UC Davis and work closely with outside collaborators to benefit the local, regional and global community. 

The DART lab is housed in Kemper Hall on the beautiful UC Davis campus and is led by Dr. Xiaoguang "Leo" Liu. Dr. Liu joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, UC Davis as an assistant professor in Nov. 2011.

The DART lab is affiliated with the Davis Millimeter-wave Research Center (DMRC), which was founded in June 2008 as an industry university cooperative research program. The DMRC is broadly focused on fostering millimeter wave technology for wireless communications, radar, sensing, and imaging systems. The activities in the DMRC range from devices, integrated circuits, components and packaging, sub-systems to system implementation.
