<section>
        <p> Welcome to the website of the Davis Adaptive RF Technology (DART) lab. We are a group of researchers with a keen interest in many exciting areas of high frequency electronics.  include:
             <ul>
                     <li>High frequency passive components</li>
                     <li> </li>
             </ul>   
                
        </p>The primary Research areas of the Davis Adaptive RF Technology (DART) lab include:
        Active and passive RF and microwave components
High-frequency integrated circuits
Biomedical, societal, and environmental applications of RF and microwave technologies

We are also committed to fostering STEM education at all levels through a variety of education and outreach activities, besides fulfilling university teaching obligations. We take full advantage of the resources at UC Davis and work closely with outside collaborators to benefit the local, regional and global community. 

The DART lab is housed in Kemper Hall on the UC Davis campus and is led by Dr. Xiaoguang "Leo" Liu. Dr. Liu joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, UC Davis as an assistant professor in Nov. 2011.

The DART lab is affiliated with the Davis Millimeter-wave Research Center (DMRC), which was founded in June 2008 as an industry university cooperative research program. The DMRC is broadly focused on fostering millimeter wave technology for wireless communications, radar, sensing, and imaging systems. The activities in the DMRC range from devices, integrated circuits, components and packaging, sub-systems to system implementation.
