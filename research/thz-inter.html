The scaling of semiconductor, especially complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies and massive parallelism of processors have continued to push our computing capabilities to meet today's data processing demand. However, the rate at which we can move large amounts of data between processors is increasingly becoming a bottleneck for achieving higher computational power. To tackle this challenge, we are investigating high-speed chip-to-chip interconnects solutions using carrier frequencies in the range of 100 GHz - 1 THz. The large amount of bandwidth available at this frequency range makes it an ideal solution for high speed data communication. An enabling technology of this effort is the use of micromachined dielectric waveguide as the interconnect medium, resulting in a significant reduction in link loss. This project in collaboration with Prof. Jane Q. Gu.
