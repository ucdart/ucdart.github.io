### Reconfigurable high frequency devices and circuits

The evolution of modern wireless communication has lead to a proliferation of different wireless standards working at wildly different frequencies. Designing radio front-ends that are compatible with multiple standards has become increasing difficult. Giving radio front-ends the ability to adapt their hardware parameters, such as frequency, bandwidth, and power, has been many RF designers' dream. At the heart of this pursuit is 

### High-speed chip-to-chip interconnects at sub-millimeter-wave frequencies

The
