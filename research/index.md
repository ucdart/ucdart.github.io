### Reconfigurable High Frequency Devices and Circuits

The evolution of modern wireless communication has lead to a proliferation of different wireless standards working at wildly different frequencies. Designing radio front-ends that are compatible with multiple standards has become increasing difficult. Giving radio front-ends the ability to adapt their hardware parameters, such as frequency, bandwidth, and power, has been the central research theme of the DART lab. We have demonstrated many tunable or reconfigurable RF devices and circuits, such as high-Q tunable filters, wide-tuning range VCOs, and micro-electromechanical switches and varctors.

### High-speed Chip-to-chip Interconnects at Sub-millimeter-wave and THz Frequencies

The scaling of semiconductor, especially complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), technologies and massive parallelism of processors have continued to push our computing capabilities to meet todayâ€™s data processing demand. However, the rate at which we can move large amounts of data between processors is increasingly becoming a bottleneck for achieving higher computational power. To tackle this challenge, we are investigating high-speed chip-to-chip interconnects solutions using carrier frequencies in the range of 100 GHz - 1 THz. The large amount of bandwidth available at this frequency range makes it an ideal solution for high speed data communication. A unique innovation of this research effort is the use of micromachined dielectric waveguide as the interconnect medium, resulting in a significant reduction in link loss. 

### Biomedical Applications of High Frequency Electronics

The DART lab has been working with industry partners to apply our expertise in high frequency electronics to medical applications. One example is the use low-power radar sensors for the detection of heart health conditions. Contrary to many existing work on radar-based stand-off detection of vital signs, our solution relies on contact-based measurement which significanlty reduces the power consumption, increases the accuracy, and improves noise/clutter rejection.
