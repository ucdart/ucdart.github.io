<p> Tunable filters can significantly reduce the complexity of future software-defined frequency- and bandwidth-agile wireless systems. Achieving wide frequency tuning range and a high unloaded quality factor (Qu) at the same time has long been a challenge for tunable filter design and implementations. Highly loaded evanescent-mode cavity filters offer a great balance between the two requirements. </p>

<p> As a graduate student, Dr. Liu pioneered the use of electrostatic micro-electromechanical actuators for the implementation of high-Q tunable evenescent-mode filters. An electronic tunable 2-pole filter was demonstrated for 3-4.7 GHz with 0.7% fractional bandwidth, insertion loss of 3.6-2.4 dB, and extracted Qu of 300-600. Further works demonstrated tunable bandpass and bandstop filters with similarly high Qu and tuning range for frequencies up to 20 GHz. </p>

<p> At UC Davis, we have continued the work exploring various aspects of the design and fabrication of novel tunable filters. We have demonstrated a design strategy for integrating lumped tuning elements with cavity filters. We have also introduced a frequency and bandwidth tunable filter design method based on dispersive coupling structures, showing bandwidth tunability of 0-10%. At the 0% bandwidth state, this coupling structure effectively shuts off the filter and can work as an RF switch without relying on an actual switch. More recently, we have also demonstrated a W-band (75-110 GHz) waveguide tunable filter with recording-breaking tunability and insertion loss. </p>
