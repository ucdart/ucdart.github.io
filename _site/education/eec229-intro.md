Radio-Frequency Micro-ElectroMechanical Systems (RF-MEMS) is a promising technology that aims to revolutionize RF system designs. RF-MEMS devices either serve to significantly improve existing system performance or promise to enable new system architectures. Being highly interdisciplinary in nature, RF-MEMS technology requires an understanding of (at least) mechanical, electrical and thermal engineering. This course focuses on the modeling, design, fabrication, and characterization of RF-MEMS while trying to provide a thorough introduction to the technology with an emphasis on how it will benefit the design of adaptive RF/microwave wireless systems. This course will be open to both graduate and undergraduate students. 

After successfully completing the course, the students are expected to be able to

- Understand the advantages and limitations of RF-MEMS technology
- Understand the working principles of the state-of-the-art RF-MEMS devices
- Evaluate the merits and drawbacks of an RF-MEMS design
- Quickly read and understand a paper on RF-MEMS and judge its quality
- Complete a design of an RF-MEMS device or circuit with the help of CAD packages
- Deliver a report and a presentation on a topic in RF-MEMS
