<p><img src="/images/emwave.png" width="250px" style="float:right; margin:0px;" /></p>

<p>EEC 130A is the first undergraduate course in which students get exposed to the concept of electromagnetics. To provide a bridge between all the “magical” behaviors of high frequency systems and the students’ background in circuit analysis, we start with a treatment of transmission line theory from a circuit perspective. Having demonstrated the major difference between low frequency and high frequency circuits and systems, we then move on the study of the more “traditional” subjects of electrostatics, magnetostatics, and Maxwell’s equations. At the end of the course, we come back to transmission line (TEM lines in particular) unifying the field and circuit theories.  </p>

<p><img src="/images/eec134.jpg" width="250px" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /></p>

<p>The EEC 134 course was created to satisfy the need for a senior project course for students who are interested in high electronic systems. The two-quarter long course emphasizes on system level design concepts and strives to provide a hands-on experience. As the course evolves, the projects start to encompass many facets of electrical engineering, including system engineering, antenna design, analog circuit design, embedded systems, and digital signal processing. </p>

<p>The first project option we have developed is the implementation of a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system that can perform range, Doppler, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements. In the first quarter, the students go through a series of structured labs to learn the basic system design concepts and acquire the necessary skills for putting together a high frequency system. In the second quarter, they propose and implement improvements to their radar system in terms of measurement accuracy, resolution, weight and power consumption. At the end of the course, their performance is partially judged in a radar competition.</p>
