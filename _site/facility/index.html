				<p>The DART lab has access to a variety of state-of-the-art modeling, fabrication, and characterization tool. Below is a glimpse of what is available. </p>

<h3 id="software-tools">Software Tools</h3>
<p>Through the generous donations and discounts from various vendors, we have access to the latest versions of the following software tools for device, circuit, and system design / analysis. </p>

<ul>
	<li> Cadence Analog Design Environment (IC) and Allegro (PCB)</li>
	<li> Keysight Advanced Design Systems (ADS), EM Pro, Genesys, and SystemVue</li>
	<li> ANSYS Electronics Desktop</li>
	<li> CST Mcirowave Studio</li>
	<li> AWR Microwave and Virtual System Simulator (VSS)</li>
	<li> Coventorware and MEMS+</li>
	<li> COMSOL Multiphysics</li>	
	<li> Tanner L-Edit</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="device-fabrication">Device Fabrication</h3>

<h4 id="microfabrication">Microfabrication</h4>
<p>For semiconductor device fabrication, we have access to <a href="http://cnm2.engineering.ucdavis.edu/">the UC Davis Center for Nano-MicroManufacturing (CNM2) </a>. CNM2 is the home for the prototype and fabrication of thin-film, micro- and nano-structures. CNM2 is housed in a 10,000 ft<sup>2</sup>  Class-1000 and -100 clean room that provides capabilities for fabricating integrated circuits and assembling hybrid modules. 
To support these activities, CNM2 is fully equipped with photolithography, etching, mask-making, metal deposition, and furnaces, vacuum systems, and assembly equipment. </p>

<p>Examples of equipment include Solitec photoresist spinner, Karl Suss mask aligner, EVG wafer- and chip-level aligner and bonder, FineTech Lambda flip-chip die bonder, PlasmaTherm ICP-PECVD, E-beam evaporator, CHA and Lesker Sputtering systems, Dektak Profilometer, RIE and DRIE etching systems, SEM, and wet etch benches. To support nano-scale fabriation, the CNM2
facility is equipped with an e-beam nanolithography. The complete list of equipment can be found <a href="http://cnm2.engineering.ucdavis.edu/the-facility/equipment/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, we have full access to the UC Berkeley Marvell Nanofabrication Laboratory (~1 hour away from Davis) with additional fabrication and characterization equipment to complement the capabilities at UC Davis.</p>

<h4 id="printed-circuit-board-pcb">Printed Circuit Board (PCB)</h4>
<p>Although the fabrication of most standard PCBs are outsourced, we do maintain a set of PCB prototyping equipment in-house for designs that require special processing. A critical piece of equipment is the T-Tech QCJ-5 60,000-rpm milling machine (shown to the right). We also have a wet-processing hood for metal
(Cu, Au, Ag, and solder) electroless-/electro-plating and etching.</p>

<h4 id="machining">Machining</h4>
<p>Through the UC Davis <a href="http://bme.ucdavis.edu/team/">BME TEAM facility </a> and <a href="https://engineering.ucdavis.edu/efl/">the Engineering Fabrication Lab </a>, we have access to various
prototyping capability, such as CNC machining, 3D printing, injection modeling, and water-jet cutting at low cost.</p>

<h3 id="characterization">Characterization</h3>
<p>The DART lab is associated with the Davis Millimeter-Wave Research Center (DMRC) which has a shared high-frequency characterization lab in Ghausi Hall on the UC Davis campus. Through collaboration with Agilent Technologies (now Keysight Technologies), we are equipped with full vector signal generation and characterization equipment up to 500 GHz. Notable examples include:</p>
<ul>
  	<li>Agilent N5247A 67-GHz non-linear Performance Network Analyzer (PNA-X) with dual sources and 4 test ports</li>
	<li>Agilent E8364A 50-GHz PNA</li>
	<li>Agilent N9030A 50-GHz PXA signal analyzer with pre-amplifier</li>
	<li>OML and VDI waveguide frequency extenders up to 500 GHz</li>
	<li>Waveguide power meter (50 GHz - 110 GHz)</li>
	<li>VDI-Erickson PM4 power meter (75 GHz - 3 THz)</li>
	<li>Harmonic mixers up to 325 GHz</li>
</ul>

<p>In our own lab (Kemper Hall 3182), we maintain a basic set of high frequency characterization equipment.</p>
<ul>
  	<li>Agilent 8722D 40-GHz Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)</li>
	<li>Agilent 5071A 8-GHz 4-port VNA</li>
	<li>Agilent E4422B and E4433B (option 1E5 &amp; UND) 4-GHz vector signal generator</li>
	<li>LeCroy WavePro7300A 3-GHz (20 Gsps) oscilloscope</li>
	<li>Tektronix RTSA3308B 8-GHz real-time spectrum analyzer</li>
	<li>Multiple DC power supplies, funtion generators, and digital multimeters</li>
</ul>
