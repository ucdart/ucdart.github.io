The extremely large bandwdith available at the millimeter-wave (mmW) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands has interesting potentials for a variety of application such as high-data rate communications, high precision sensing (radar), and low-cost spectroscopy. The technology scaling of silicon integrated circuits, primarily driven by the desire to faster and lower-power CPUs, has resulted in extremely fast transistors. In fact, the maximum oscillation frequency of a CMOS transistor has now exceeded 400 GHz in some processes! This naturally motivated many researcher to look at
