### Welcome to the website of the Davis Advanced RF Technologies (DART) lab
<img src="/images/gallery.gif" width="300px" style="float:right; margin-top:10px; margin-left:15px;">

We are a group of researchers with a keen interest in many exciting areas of high frequency electronics. The definition of "high frequency" here refers to a range of a few tens of megahertz to hundreds of gigahertz. Our research interests include:

- Reconfigurable high frequency devices and components, particularly tunable filters and matching networks;
- High efficiency and high power amplifiers, oscillators, and frequency synthesizers;
- Millimeter-wave synthetic imaging systems;
- High frequency communication and radar systems and their application in biomedical, societal, and environmental applications.

Critical to our scientific research efforts is a fundamental understanding of the phenomena, physics, and engineering principles of high frequency electronics. A major mission of our work is to formulate and disseminate such knowledge through the curriculum and the training we provide to both the students and researchers at the University.
<!---
The DART lab is housed in Kemper Hall on the beautiful UC Davis campus. The lab is affiliated with the Davis Millimeter-wave Research Center (DMRC). The DMRC is broadly focused on fostering millimeter wave technology for wireless communications, radar, sensing, and imaging systems.
