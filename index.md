We are a group of researchers with a keen interest in many exciting areas of high-frequency and high-speed electronics. Our [research](/research/) interests include:

- High-frequency (RF to THz) integrated circuits;
- Microelectronic and photonic devices, such as micro-electromechanical (MEMS) devices;
- Novel antennas, frequency selective surfaces, and passive components;
- Reconfigurable high-frequency circuits and systems;
<!-- - High-precision sensing systems using radar and laser time-of-flight (ToF) principles; -->
- Applications of high-frequency electronics to biomedical, industrial, environmental, and humanitarian problems;
- High-speed wireline and optical communications circuits.

Critical to our scientific research efforts is a pursuit of fundamental understanding of the engineering principles of high frequency electronics. A major mission of our work is to formulate and disseminate such understanding through university [education](/education/) as well as community [outreach](/education/outreach.html).

The DART lab is housed in Kemper Hall on the beautiful UC Davis campus. The lab is affiliated with the Davis Millimeter-wave Research Center (DMRC). The DMRC is broadly focused on fostering millimeter wave technology for wireless communications, radar, sensing, and imaging systems.
