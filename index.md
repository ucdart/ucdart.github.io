### Welcome to the website of the Davis Adaptive RF Technology (DART) lab

We are a group of researchers with a keen interest in many exciting areas of high frequency electronics. The definition of "high frequency" here refers to a range of a few tens of megahertz to hundreds of gigahertz. Our research interests  include:

- Reconfigurable high frequency devices and components, particularly tunable filters and matching networks;
- High efficiency and high power amplifiers, oscillators, and frequency synthesizers;
- Millimeter-wave synthetic imaging systems;
- High frequency communication and radar systems and their application in biomedical, societal, and environmental applications.
	
Critical to our scientific research efforts is a fundamental understanding of the phenomena, physics, and engineering principles of high frequency electronics. A major mission of our work is to formulate and disseminate such knowledge through the curriculum and the training we provide to both the students and researchers at the University.

The DART lab is housed in Kemper Hall on the beautiful UC Davis campus. The lab is affiliated with the Davis Millimeter-wave Research Center (DMRC). The DMRC is broadly focused on fostering millimeter wave technology for wireless communications, radar, sensing, and imaging systems.
