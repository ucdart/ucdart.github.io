Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have garnered much attention in recent years because of their potential in a variety of civilian applications, such as aerial vieography, surveying, remote sensing, and wireless connectivity and location. Much of this excitement stems from technology advancement in areas such as low-cost computation platforms, small form factor sensors (inertial, GPS, lidar, etc), and miniaturized timing units. 

We have assembled a team of undergraduate and graduate students to investigate various aspects of small UAV technologies. Of particular interest to us are the following topics: 

<ul>
	<li> Remote sensing in the infrared and radio wave spectrums</li>
	<li> Situation awareness and autonomous collision avoidance </li>
	<li> Distributed and coorperative radio-frequency sensing and location</li>
	<li> Aerial-connected wireless sensors and wireless sensor networks </li>
	<li> Energy efficienty UAV platform development</li>
</ul>


### Projects

* Minjie Zhu and Samuel Cheung, "Computer vision based UAV navigation](/education/files/eec181_UAV_Final_Report.pdf)"


* Christopher Bird, Shalmali Joshi, Lindsey Raven, Angela Tobin, "[Computer vision based UAV navigation](/education/files/eec181_UAV_Final_Report.pdf)". Here is a [link to their final test video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygKTjIUttk4). Unfortunately the UAV platform was not functioning well towards the end and they were not able to do a real flight test. Instead they hold the quadcopter frame and "simulated" a flight test by personally moving the frame according to the instruction of the processor.
