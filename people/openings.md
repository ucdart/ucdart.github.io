### Joining DART Lab as a PhD Student

One of the philosophies of our group is to provide the students with a comprehensive training/learning experience in a diversity of technical directions. We are lucky to have a group of talented researchers, students, and collaborators with diverse expertise in micro-devices, passive/active circuits, and system design.

We are always looking for motivated students and researchers to join our group at UC Davis. Typical characteristics that we are looking for include strong motivation, good work ethics, strong analytical and hands-on skills, and above all, a curiosity about <strong>how things work </strong> and <strong>why they work</strong>.

Although the type and number of openings vary from year to year with the level of research funding, interested candidates should always free feel to contact Dr. Liu (lxgliu@ucdavis.edu) or [other group members](/people/) to learn about the activities and the atomsphere in the group.

### To Undergraduate Students Seeking Research Experience

Our general recommendation for undergraduate students is to focus on getting good grades in your coursework. However, if you feel that you have extra time and energy, and/or that you want to explore research experience over the summer, you are most welcome to contact Dr. Liu for more information.

For students with US citizenship, we currently have a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program that can provide some level of financial support. The project is aimed at developing novel device, circuit, and signal processing techniques to realize reconfigurable bandpass-sampling receivers for softwared defined radio (SDR) applications.

### To UC Davis Master Students Seeking a Project

We welcome master students who want to either experience graduate research or gain practical electronics skills for better preparation of a future job. Since most of the projects in our group relate to building actual hardware, which generally requires a longer time for the student to acquire the necessary skills and produce results, we take only **Plan 1** students who can start working on their research project from either the Fall or the Winter quarter of the first year.

We treat Plan 1 master student similarly as PhD students, expecting critical thinking and strong work ethics. Accordingly, we provide similar support to Plan 1 students in terms of office space, computation resources, tape-out/prototyping opportunities, etc, with the exception of financial support.

Students who are interested in Plan 2 should enroll in the **EEC290B** capstone project course.  

In particular, we are looking for students interested in one or more of the following topics:

 - Analog and RFIC design

 - Board-level RF front-end system design

 - High-speed data acquisition system design

 - Small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) design

 - Radar signal processing

<!--
In our lab, the expectations for a master student is that he/she must be able to contribute at least 10 hours/week to the master project. There will usually be a one-quarter "evaluation" period to determine there is enough "chemistry" between the advisor and the student.

If you are a Master student looking for a project in our group, please make sure that you start the discussion with Dr. Liu in your first year here!
