Prof. Xiaoguang Liu received his Bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University, China, in 2004 and Ph.D. degree from Purdue University, USA, in 2010. He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis in Nov. 2011 as an assistant professor and was promoted to an associate professor in Jul. 2017. At UC Davis, his research group is investigating various aspects of cutting-edge high-frequency circuit and system design and implementation concepts. Besides typical duties inside the University and professional societies, Dr. Liu has consulted for a number of companies and national labs on topics related to high-frequency circuits, antennas, and systems. His amateur radio call sign is AI6DW.
