### Projects

* Christopher Bird, Shalmali Joshi, Lindsey Raven, Angela Tobin, "[Computer vision based UAV navigation](/education/files/eec181_UAV_Final_Report.pdf)". Here is a [link to their final test video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygKTjIUttk4). Unfortunately the UAV platform was not functioning well towards the end and they were not able to do a real flight test. Instead they hold the quadcopter frame and "simulated" a flight test by personally moving the frame according to the instruction of the processor.
