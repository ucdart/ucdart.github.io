Filters are ubiquitous components in high frequency electronic systems. Jokingly known as the ``RF engineers' bandage'', RF and microwave filters find use in band/channel selection, image rejection, anti-aliasing, and pretty much anywhere undesired signals need to be eliminated. This course intends to provide a thorough and up-to-date overview of the design theories and implementation techniques for RF and microwave filters. The targeted audience is senior undergraduate students and graduate students with a basic background in circuit analysis and RF engineering. 

The topics covered in this course include:

- Review of network analysis and synthesis techniques
- Filter approximations and prototype synthesis
- Frequency and impedance transformations
- Coupled resonator filters and the coupling matrix
- Design of microstrip and waveguide filters
- Mechanical and micro-mechanical filters
- Tunable filters and wide-band filters
