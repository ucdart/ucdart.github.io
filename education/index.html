<h4>EEC 130A Introductory Electromagntics I </h4>

<p>
EEC 130A is the first undergraduate course in which students get exposed to the concept of electromagnetics. To provide a bridge between all the <i>magical</i> behaviors of high frequency systems and the students' background in circuit analysis, we start with a treatment of transmission line theory from a circuit perspective. Having demonstrated the major difference between low frequency and high frequency circuits and systems, we then move on the study of the more <i>traditional</i> subjects of electrostatics, magnetostatics, and Maxwell's equations. At the end of the course, we come back to transmission line (TEM lines in particular) with a unified perspective incorporating both field and circuit theories.

Images are contained within the paragraph tag. The image has floated to the left, and also to the right because we have used both types of image floating in this example. Notice how the text wraps around the images quite nicely. The images are contained within the paragraph tag.
