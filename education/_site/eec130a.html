<p>EEC 130A is the first undergraduate course in which students get exposed to the concept of electromagnetics. To provide a bridge between all the “magical” behaviors of high frequency systems and the students’ background in circuit analysis, we start with a treatment of transmission line theory from a circuit perspective. Having demonstrated the major difference between low frequency and high frequency circuits and systems, we then move on the study of the more “traditional” subjects of electrostatics, magnetostatics, and Maxwell’s equations. At the end of the course, we come back to transmission line (TEM lines in particular) unifying the field and circuit theories.</p>
