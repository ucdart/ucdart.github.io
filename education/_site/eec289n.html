<p>Filters are ubiquitous components in high frequency electronic systems. Jokingly known as the ``RF engineers’ bandage’’, RF and microwave filters find use in band/channel selection, image rejection, anti-aliasing, and pretty much anywhere undesired signals need to be eliminated. This course intends to provide a thorough and up-to-date overview of the design theories and implementation techniques for RF and microwave filters. The targeted audience is senior undergraduate students and graduate students with a basic background in circuit analysis and RF engineering. </p>

<p>The topics covered in this course include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review of network analysis and synthesis techniques</li>
  <li>Filter approximations and prototype synthesis</li>
  <li>Frequency and impedance transformations</li>
  <li>Coupled resonator filters and the coupling matrix</li>
  <li>Design of microstrip and waveguide filters</li>
  <li>Mechanical and micro-mechanical filters</li>
  <li>Tunable filters and wide-band filters</li>
</ul>
