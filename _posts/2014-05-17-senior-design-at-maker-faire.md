Students of the EEC 134 senior design project are showcasing their design, a radar shield for Arduino, at the 2014 Maker Faire in San Mateo. We plan to open source both the hardware and the software of the design. Visit our senior design page for more information on the course. AND stay tuned for more photos, videos, and an updated website.
