	<li> Cadence Analog Design Environment (IC) and Allegro (PCB)</li>
	<li> Keysight Advanced Design Systems (ADS), EM Pro, Genesys, and SystemVue</li>
	<li> ANSYS Electronics Desktop</li>
	<li> CST Mcirowave Studio</li>
	<li> AWR Microwave and Virtual System Simulator (VSS)</li>
	<li> Coventorware and MEMS+</li>
	<li> COMSOL Multiphysics</li>	
	<li> Tanner L-Edit</li>
</ul>

### Device Fabrication

#### Microfabrication

For semiconductor device fabrication, we have access to the UC Davis Center for Nano-MicroManufacturing (CNM2). CNM2 is the home for the prototype and fabrication of thin-film, micro- and nano-structures. CNM2 is housed in a 10,000 ft<sup>2</sup>  Class-1000 and -100 clean room that provides capabilities for fabricating integrated circuits and assembling hybrid modules. 
To support these activities, CNM2 is fully equipped with photolithography, etching, mask-making, metal deposition, and furnaces, vacuum systems, and assembly equipment. 

Examples of equipment include Solitec photoresist spinner, Karl Suss mask aligner, EVG wafer- and chip-level aligner and bonder, FineTech Lambda flip-chip die bonder, PlasmaTherm ICP-PECVD, E-beam evaporator, CHA and Lesker Sputtering systems, Dektak Profilometer, RIE and DRIE etching systems, SEM, and wet etch benches. To support nano-scale fabriation, the CNM2
facility is equipped with an e-beam nanolithography. The complete list of equipment can be found at <a href="http://cnm2.engineering.ucdavis.edu/the-facility/equipment/">http://cnm2.engineering.ucdavis.edu/the-facility/equipment/</a>.

In addition, we have full access to the UC Berkeley Marvell Nanofabrication Laboratory (~1 hour away from Davis) with additional fabrication and characterization equipment to complement the capabilities at UC Davis.
 
#### Printed Circuit Board (PCB)

Although the fabrication of most standard PCBs are outsourced, we do maintain a set of PCB prototyping equipment in-house for designs that require special processing. A critical piece of equipment is the T-Tech QCJ-5 60,000-rpm milling machine (shown to the right). We also have a wet-processing hood for metal
plating (Cu, Au, and Sg) and etching.


### Characterization

The DART lab is associated with the Davis Millimeter-Wave Research Center (DMRC) which is equipped with high frequency characterization equipment needed to carry out the proposed research and education activities. The DMRC lab has extensive laboratories and equipment that are used for device and circuit characterization and system integration at millimeter-wave and THz frequencies. The DMRC has recently acquired a 325-GHz Non-linear Performance Network Analyzer (PNA-X) and a 325-GHz Spectrum  Analyzer (PXA) from Agilent Technologies. Four sets of multiplier modules are used with the 67-GHz PNA-X controllers to extend the vector network measurements from \SI{67}{GHz} to \SI{325}{GHz}. Signal/spectrum analysis can be carried out to 325 GHz using a PXA spectrum analyzer with a state-of-the-art noise floor of -172\,dBm.  External mixers can be used to analyze signals to 325\,GHz.


The PI maintains the following equipment in his lab for high-frequency circuit
characterization:

  	\item 1$\times$ E4422 \SI{250}{kHz}--\SI{4.0}{GHz} ESG Series Signal
  	Generator
	\item 2$\times$ 8663A Synthesized Signal Generator (\SI{2.65}{GHz})
	\item 1$\times$ 8350B Sweep Oscillator 
	\item 1$\times$ 54600B Oscilloscope 
	\item 1$\times$ E5071A 300\,kHz--8.5\,GHz four-port Vector Network Analyzer 
	\item 1$\times$ 8722D 50\,MHz--40\,GHz Vector Network Analyzer
	\item 1$\times$ 5343A Microwave Frequency Counter 
	\item Multiple DC power supplies, funtion generators, and digital multimeters
\end{itemize}
