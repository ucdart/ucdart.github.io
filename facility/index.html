\section{Modeling and Analysis}

For modeling and analysis of MEMS
devices, high frequency components, circuits, and systems, the PI has access to a wide range of EDA software packages: 
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-0.6ex]
\item Ansys HFSS, CST Microwave Studio, Sonnet, Agilent Momentum (full-wave
electromagnetic simulation)
\item Ansys Designer and Agilent ADS (RF circuit and system simulation)
\item Coventorware and COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM simulation for MEMS devices)
\end{itemize}

The PI's lab maintains several high performance workstations and has access to the College of Engineering computing cluster for heavy-duty computation needs. 

\section{Device Fabrication}

The PI is associated with the UC Davis Center for Nano-MicroManufacturing (CNM2), which is equipped with the fabrication tools needed to carry out the proposed
research and education activities.

\end{wrapfigure}

CNM2 (Fig.~\ref{fig:cnm2}) is the home for the prototype and
fabrication of thin-film, micro- and nano-structures. CNM2 is housed in
a \num{10000} ft$^2$ Class-\num{1000} and -100 clean room that provides
capabilities for fabricating integrated circuits and assembling hybrid modules. 
To support these activities, CNM2 is fully equipped with
photolithography, etching, mask-making, metal deposition, and furnaces, vacuum
systems, and assembly equipment. Examples of equipment include Solitec photoresist spinner,
Karl Suss mask aligner, EVG wafer- and chip-level aligner and bonder, FineTech Lambda flip-chip die bonder, PlasmaTherm ICP-PECVD, E-beam evaporator, CHA and Lesker
Sputtering systems, Dektak Profilometer, RIE and DRIE etching systems, SEM, and
wet etch benches. To support nano-scale fabriation, the CNM2
facility is equipped with an e-beam nanolithography. The complete list of
equipment can be found at \url{http://cnm2.engineering.ucdavis.edu/the-facility/equipment/}.

The PI also maintains a complete set of PCB prototyping equipment in his own lab.
These include a \num{60000} rpm milling machine, a wet-processing hood for metal
plating (Cu, Au, and Sg) and etching, and a thermal laminator.

In addition, PI has full access to the UC Berkeley Marvell Nanofabrication Laboratory with additional fabrication and characterization equipment to complement the capabilities at UC Davis.
 
\section{Device Characterization}
The PI maintains the following equipment in his lab for high-frequency circuit
characterization:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-0.6ex]
  	\item 1$\times$ E4422 \SI{250}{kHz}--\SI{4.0}{GHz} ESG Series Signal
  	Generator
	\item 2$\times$ 8663A Synthesized Signal Generator (\SI{2.65}{GHz})
	\item 1$\times$ 8350B Sweep Oscillator 
	\item 1$\times$ 54600B Oscilloscope 
	\item 1$\times$ E5071A 300\,kHz--8.5\,GHz four-port Vector Network Analyzer 
	\item 1$\times$ 8722D 50\,MHz--40\,GHz Vector Network Analyzer
	\item 1$\times$ 5343A Microwave Frequency Counter 
	\item Multiple DC power supplies, funtion generators, and digital multimeters
\end{itemize}

In addition, the PI is associated with the Davis Millimeter-Wave Research Center (DMRC)
which is equipped with high frequency characterization equipment needed to carry out the proposed research and education activities. The DMRC lab has extensive laboratories and equipment that are used for device and circuit characterization and system integration at millimeter-wave and THz frequencies. The DMRC has recently acquired a \SI{325}{GHz} Non-linear Performance Network Analyzer (PNA-X) and a 325~GHz Spectrum  Analyzer (PXA) from Agilent Technologies (Fig.~\ref{fig:agilent}. Four sets of multiplier modules are used with the \SI{67}{GHz} PNA-X controllers to extend the vector network measurements from \SI{67}{GHz} to \SI{325}{GHz}. Signal/spectrum analysis can be carried out to 325\,GHz using a PXA spectrum analyzer with a state-of-the-art noise floor of -172\,dBm.  External mixers can be used to analyze signals to 325\,GHz.
